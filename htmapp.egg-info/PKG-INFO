Description: # Sample package structure  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lsawade/how_to_make_a_python_package.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lsawade/how_to_make_a_python_package)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/how-to-make-a-python-package/badge/?version=latest)](https://how-to-make-a-python-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        This is a tiny, little package that shows how to easily setup a python 
        package that includes
        
        1. Modularized structure
        2. A simple unittest setup using `.travis.yml`
        3. An easy environment building option via `environment.yml`
        4. Documentation of the code based on sphinx.
        
        With this sample repository and a few instructions you should be good to go 
        to create your own repositories that are simple to distribute and easily 
        reproducible in the future.
        
        ## Where do you start?
        
        The simplest way is to take a peak into the documentation which is located 
        here: [Documentation](https://how-to-make-a-python-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
        There, I will explain and go through the few necessary steps to get you started
        to package your modules.
        
        
        ## Installation of this package
        
        A few simple steps:
        
        ```bash
        # Create the conda environment and install dependencies
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        
        # Activate the conda environment
        conda activate htmapp
        
        # Install your package
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        The `-e` simply let's you modify the package without having to reinstall it 
        all the time.
